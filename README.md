# NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2019

We are all used to headlines and articles that show us what climate change is doing to our planet, but most of the time it's in the form of charts and graphs. In order to raise awareness to this problem, we believe people need to see what its consequences are. Thats why we made our mission to create a visualization tool accesible by anyone where you can change the level of the water to see what it would do to the planet. We used web technologies for its development, this way it can be used in any device, from laptops to mobile phones.
